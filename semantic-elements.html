<h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
<h2>DC heroes</h2>
<p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br>
  The storyline is better and <u>often addresses real life social issues</u>. <strong>Green arrow</strong> is my favorite.</p>

<h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
<p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more 2 dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industry, whereas DC's attempts are more mediocre.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p> But they do have decent movies and TV shows for whatever that's worth.</p>
<blockquote>To summarize, marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
