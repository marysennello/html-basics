    <p>I adopted Melon at the end of February 2021. My partner and I decided to get a cat and since it was going to be his first cat, we wanted to make sure they had a good connection. When we went to meet some potential cats, Melon came and sat on Mikey's lap and cuddled up. Within a few weeks, we had brought him home!</p>
    Melon is an American Shorthair brown tabby cat. He is a very sweet boy. He loves looking out the window at birds, cuddling up at night, and sitting next to me while i get ready in the morning. If there's one thing he hates, it's crows.</p>
